name: Inclusion Counts (Any user)
description: >-
  This endpoint is very similar to the Facets endpoint with the facet key
  `inclusion_counts` selected in the query. The only difference is that this
  endpoint is useful when retrieving inclusion counts for other users in the
  same review, even if the blind mode is on. An example application to this is
  to display a chart of progress for each user without toggling the blind mode
  to off.

  A special `user_id` of `0` returns the "agreed on" decisions for all users in the review. It matches the results returned from the Facets endpoint when the blind mode is off.
