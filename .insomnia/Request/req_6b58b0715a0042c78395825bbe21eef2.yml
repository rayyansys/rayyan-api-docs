  Use this endpoint to trigger a dedup job for a review.


  The response indicates whether the job was triggered, and if it wasn't gives the reason as to why.


  Additionally, a push notification will be sent to the frontend application once the dedup job is complete. Dedup results data can then be retrieved using the `GET /articles` or `GET /facets` endpoint.


  The following are the list of reasons:


  - `LIMIT_EXCEEDED`: The review contains more than the 200,000 article limit for reviews. Contact support to run a dedup job on such a review.

  - `JOB_RUNNING`: A dedup job is already running for this review.

  - `SEARCH_REQUIRED`: A search needs to be added or deleted for a dedup job to be triggered.
