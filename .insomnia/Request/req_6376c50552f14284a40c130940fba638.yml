    - `live` or `nil`, the endpoint will return the live reviews.
  	- `archived`, the endpoint will return the archived reviews.

  - `page`: Pagination param, when:
  	- `page` value is greater than `0`, the endpoint returns the specified page with page's length is `10`
  	- `page` is left blank and the `archive_state` is `live`, the endpoint will return all live reviews.
  	- `page` is left blank and the `archive_state` is `archived`, the endpoint will return the first page of archived reviews.  


  All review fields are straightforward to understand. There are three fields that worth explaining. Clients should keep track of changes in the values of these fields and take appropriate action if any one changes:

  1. `articles_etag`: It changes whenever a user adds new articles or removes articles from the review (does not apply to marking articles as duplicates). Clients should clear the cached copy of all articles and ask the user to download the review articles again.

  1. `inclusions_etag`: It changes whenever a user adds a decision to any article (include/exclude/maybe). Clients should invalidate the inclusion counts facet if stored locally, or refresh it if it is displayed on screen. They should also trigger the customizations sync workflow if not done already on receiving the push message

  1. `labels_etag`: Same as above but for user labels and exclusion reasons. It applies to the user labels or exclusion reasons facets
