description: >-
  Endpoint for generating a pre-signed URL to upload searches to S3.


  The validity of the URL is **one hour** from time of creation. Additionally, 

  multiple files can be uploaded to the same pre-signed URL where it acts as a prefix (folder).


  Uploading a file successfully to the URL returns a 201 HTTP response. 


  Uploading a file using an expired URL returns a 400 HTTP response.


  For more information about pre-signed URLs, read the AWS documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html).
