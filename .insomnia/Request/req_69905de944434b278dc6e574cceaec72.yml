description: >-
  This endpoint will fetch the URL you should redirect the enduser to it to
  authenticate rayyan with mendeley



  If your are a mobile client:  

  You should open the link in an in-app browser tab, and check for the http status code for this tab.  


  If your are a web client:  

  You should open the link in an new tab, and listen when the URL changed to `rayyan.ai` url , then check for the http status code for this tab.


  ---

  Http status code: 


  - If you got `200 OK` you should extract the `code` param from the browser tab and make a request with the code to `Generate access token from code` endpoint.

  - If you got `204 Created`  it's means that an access token has already generated and no need to capture the `code` and no need to call `Generate access token from code` endpoint, instead you should call `Fetch valid access token` to get a valid access token.
